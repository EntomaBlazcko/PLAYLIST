        Or am I you? <br>
        Get in the moment, hold your breath under the sea <br>
        My head is haunted but my heart's for you to see <br>
        I give my all, and it just don't compare to you <br>
        Wanna erase my thoughts of me <br>
        And fill it up with thoughts of you <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Give it a day <br>
        I know it feels like shit ain't ever easy <br>
        Throw it away <br>
        The worst aint even bad better believe me <br>
        Do u feel me? <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        So give it all to me, loosen up a bit <br>
        I know you'll set me free, it's just you and me <br>
        Because I'm <br>
        <br>
        Fallin' faster, something tells me what to do <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Takin' all of my energy back to you <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Fallin' faster, something tells me what to do <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Takin' all of my energy back to you <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        <br>
        I'm Pac in ninety-five, it's just me against the world <br>
        Wonder what he would say if he was alive <br>
        To pimp a butterfly that sounds like beauty to me <br>
        When I roam the streets it's just me that I seek <br>
        <br>
        It's just me in the hills <br>
        It's just me with these thrills <br>
        Doing me at what cost at what loss <br>
        Insensitivity ignorance and dense <br>
        What use is being positive <br>
        When I never had a fuck to give <br>
        Man let a brother live <br>
        Let a brother step <br>
        <br>
        If a brother chooses to its to his own demise <br> 
        White lies and blank minds no surprise <br>
        Pesos pay low <br>
        How far do I go? <br>
        Considering selling my soul <br>
        Death of my ego for all that dough <br>
        Start the show <br>
        <br>
        Hiding behind masks, and I'm fallin' (so fast) <br>
        Lookin' at myself in the mirror <br>
        Questioning where are u when I need ya <br>
        Talkin' to myself cos the enemy <br>
        A reflection of ya <br>
        Insane in the brain I might <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Mixed up what's wrong from right <br>
        We'd been up all night <br>
        Just foolin' away <br>
        I'd heard that song all day <br>
        My own art is haunting me <br>
        Please just give me one more day <br>
        To fix what i can't take <br>
        <br>
        Boy you make your mind up <br>
        Straight it and then man up <br>
        Point it to the core where I'm weak <br>
        And all fucked up <br>
        Fallin' faster, something tells me what to do <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Takin' all of my energy back to you <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Fallin' faster, something tells me what to do <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
        Takin' all of my energy back to you <br>
        (Is it me or am I you) <br>
