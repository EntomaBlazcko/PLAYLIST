                Ayy, yes, I thought of things I wanna say but never said it <br>
                Searching how to get a girls' attention up on reddit<br>
                Sick of all these worries burying my face side in<br>
                Wishin' I could talk without awkward silence<br>
                <br>
                Shit, I'm indecisive, never made my mind up<br>
                I say I'm not depressed 'cause isn't everybody kind of?<br>
                <br>
                Hope that I'ma win you over eventually (Eventually)<br>
                Wonder if I'll steal the heart of someone better than me<br>
                <br>
                And I don't care for what I've got<br>
                'Cause you're the only one I want<br>
                But I can't reach what's in my sight (My sight)<br>
                Take a step into my life<br>
                <br>
                And I don't care for what I've got (I've got)<br>
                'Cause you're the only one I want (I want)<br>
                But I can't reach what's in my sight (my sight)<br>
                Take a step into my life<br>
                Into my life (My life)<br>
                <br>
                Take a step into my life<br>
                <br>
                Ayy, diving into the weekend, all I do is sleep in<br>
                Friends hit me up hardly, all they do is party<br>
                How am I supposed to have fun?<br>
                If I know that I'll never be the one?<br>
                Diving into the night-time, all I do is write rhymes<br>
                Flippin' through these pages, nothing ever changes<br>
                <br>
                Show me how to have a good time<br>
                <br>
                'Cause I can never get this shit right<br>
                <br>
                And I don't care for what I've got<br>
                'Cause you're the only one I want<br>
                But I can't reach what's in my sight (My sight)<br>
