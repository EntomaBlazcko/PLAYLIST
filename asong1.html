            One thing I don't know why <br>
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
            To explain in due time<br>
            <br>
            All I know<br>
            Time is a valuable thing<br>
            Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
            Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
            The clock ticks life away<br>
            <br>
            It's so unreal<br>
            Didn't look out below<br>
            Watch the time go right out the window<br>
            Tryin' to hold on, did-didn't even know<br>
            I wasted it all just to watch you go<br>
            <br>
            I kept everything inside and even though I tried<br>
            It all fell apart<br>
            What it meant to me will eventually<br>
            Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard<br>
            <br>
            I tried so hard and got so far<br>
            But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
            I had to fall to lose it all<br>
            But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>

            One thing, I don't know why<br>
            It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
            Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme<br>
            To remind myself how I tried so hard<br>
            <br>
            In spite of the way you were mockin' me<br>
            Acting like I was part of your property<br>
            Remembering all the times you fought with me<br>
            I'm surprised it got so far<br>
            <br>
            Things aren't the way they were before<br>
            You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br>
            Not that you knew me back then<br>
            But it all comes back to me in the end<br>
            <br>
            You kept everything inside and even though I tried<br>
            It all fell apart<br>
            What it meant to me will eventually<br>
            Be a memory of a time when I tried so hard<br>
            <br>
            I tried so hard and got so far<br>

            I had to fall to lose it all<br>
            But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
            <br>
            I've put my trust in you<br>
            Pushed as far as I can go<br>
            For all this<br>
            There's only one thing you should know<br>
            <br>
            I've put my trust in you<br>
