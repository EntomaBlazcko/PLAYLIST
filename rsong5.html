    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
        The birds have left their trees <br>
        The light pours onto me<br>
        I can feel you lying there all on your own<br>
        We got here the hard way<br>
        All those words that we exchange<br>
        Is it any wonder things get broke?<br>
        <br>
        'Cause in my heart and in my head<br>
        I'll never take back the things I said<br>
        So high above, I feel it coming down<br>
        She said, in my heart and in my head<br>
        Tell me why this has to end<br>
        Oh, no, oh, no<br>
        <br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall<br>
        We built this town on shaky ground<br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no<br>
        We built it up to pull it down<br>
        <br>
        Now all the birds have fled<br>
        The hurt just leaves me scared<br>
        Losing everything I've ever known<br>
        It's all become too much<br>
        Maybe I'm not built for love<br>
        If I knew that I could reach you, I would go<br>
        <br>
        It's in my heart and in my head<br>
        You can't take back the things you said<br>
        So high above, I feel it coming down<br>
        She said, in my heart and in my head<br>
        Tell me why this has to end<br>
        Oh, no, oh, no<br>
        <br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall<br>
        We built this town on shaky ground<br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no<br>
        We built it up to pull it down<br>
        <br>
        Yeah, we build it up and we build it up<br>
        Yeah, we build it up to pull it down<br>
        And we build it up and we build it up<br>
        And we build it up to pull it down<br>
        <br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall<br>
        We built this town on shaky ground<br>
        I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no<br>
        We built it up to pull it down<br>
